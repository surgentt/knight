##Knight

Here's the problem, if you're interested: it's called "The Knight's Tour".

A knight, or "horse", is a chess piece that, in one move, can jump to any space on the board that is 2 squares away in one direction, and 1 square away in other direction. Basically 'L' shapes. (if this isn't clear, please ask for clarification).

The question is this: from a given starting position (let's say the 'bottom left' of the board to start with), for an n by n chess board (a regular chess board is 8 by 8) is there a path a knight can take to visit all positions on a chess board exactly once, never revisiting any square?
